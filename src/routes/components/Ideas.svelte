                I'm currently interning at Straumann group Montreal, the largest French-speaking city in America.
                With a team of highly skilled and passionate developers, we're working on all sorts of
                different improvements and integrations for our CAD software products, Nova and Cares Visuals. If you're
                interested in a collaboration or have an awesome idea you want to share with me, simply
                <span class="transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out transform group-hover:font-bold">reach out to me via email</span>.
            </p>
