        <h2>What data does flaming.codes collect?</h2>
        <p>
            portfolio-beaudelaire.web.app doesn't collect any personal information about you. No cookies at all get created, not by
            the beaudelaire.github.io itself or any other 3rd party company.

        <h2>Why is there no cookie consent banner?</h2>
        <p>
            Because no personal data is collected and absolutely no cookies are set, there simply isn't a need to
            show a consent banner.
